Goal: Standardize the `render` method in all view components and simplify the `router.js` logic.

Plan:

1.  Analyze Login-related Files:
    *   `src/features/login/loginView.js`: Update `render(container)` to `render(container, model)`.
    *   `src/features/login/registerView.js`: Update `render(container)` to `render(container, model)`.
    *   `src/features/login/login.js`: Analyze this file to understand its role and see if any changes are needed to support the view updates. (Already analyzed and determined to be an older, unused file).

2.  Systematically Refactor All Views: Go through all the remaining view files identified in `src/app/app.js` and apply the same `render(container, model)` signature update. The list of files to be updated are:
    *   `src/features/dashboard/DashboardView.js`
    *   `src/features/crm/CrmView.js`
    *   `src/features/workout/workoutHistoryView.js`
    *   `src/features/gym/coachingDashboardView.js`
    *   `src/features/gym/workoutPlannerMemberProgressView.js`
    *   `src/features/progress/progressView.js`
    *   `src/features/Analysis/Reports/reportsView.js`
    *   `src/features/settings/settingsView.js`
    *   `src/features/gym/analysisView.js`
    *   `src/features/gym/trainingAnalyserView.js`
    *   `src/features/billing/billingView.js`
    *   `src/features/settings/invoiceTemplateView.js`
    *   `src/features/settings/roomManagementView.js`
    *   `src/features/settings/lessonScheduleView.js`
    *   `src/features/progress/memberProgressDetailView.js`

3.  Update the Router: Once all views are standardized, modify `src/core/router.js`:
    *   Remove the backward-compatibility code that passes `model || []`.
    *   The call will be changed from `view.render(this.mainContent, model || [], routeData);` to `view.render(this.mainContent, model, routeData);`.

4.  Final Review: Perform a final check to ensure consistency across the project.
