# Plan: Final Knowledge Base Consolidation

The objective was to perform a full and final migration of all data from the source `DB` directory into a single, correctly structured `MYDB.json` file.

*   [x] **Step 1: Full Migration Execution**
    A migration script was used to recursively scan the entire `DB` directory. The script read every `.json` file and built a complete, nested JSON object that mirrors the directory structure, overwriting the previous `MYDB.json`.

*   [x] **Step 2: Verification**
    After the migration, a verification process was run. This programmatically compared the contents of the newly created `MYDB.json` against the original source files to guarantee that all data was transferred accurately. The verification was successful.

*   [x] **Step 3: Final Cleanup**
    With `MYDB.json` verified as complete and correct, the redundant `DB` directory and any temporary scripts were removed, leaving a clean project containing only the final database and the query tool.
