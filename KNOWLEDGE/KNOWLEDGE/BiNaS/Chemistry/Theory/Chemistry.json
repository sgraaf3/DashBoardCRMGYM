This occurs because, as the valence shell approaches being more than half-full, it becomes energetically more favorable for an atom to gain electrons rather than lose them.[4, 8]\n* Down a group (from top to bottom), electronegativity typically decreases. This is attributed to the increasing atomic number down a group, which leads to a greater distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus (i.e., a larger atomic radius), thus reducing the nuclear attraction for incoming electrons.[8]\n* Notable exceptions include the noble gases, which generally do not have electronegativity values due to their already complete valence shells, and the lanthanides and actinides, whose complex chemistry often deviates from these general trends.[8]",
                "**Ionization Energy (IE)** is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to remove one electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state.[4] Ionization processes are always endothermic, meaning energy must be supplied, and thus IE values are always positive.[5]\n* Across a period, the first ionization energy (IE₁) generally increases. This is due to an increasing effective nuclear charge experienced by valence electrons from left to right, which holds them more tightly to the nucleus, requiring more energy for removal.[4, 5, 8]\n* Down a group, the first ionization energy generally decreases. As the principal quantum number (n) for valence electrons increases, atoms become larger, and the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons diminishes. This makes the valence electrons easier to remove.[5]\n* Minor deviations from this general trend occur. For example, the IE₁ of boron is slightly less than that of beryllium, despite boron having more protons. This is because removing a *p* electron from boron is energetically easier than removing an *s* electron from beryllium in the same shell.[5] Similarly, oxygen's IE₁ is slightly lower than nitrogen's due to electron-electron repulsion in oxygen's paired *p* orbital, which is relieved upon electron removal.[5]\n* **Successive Ionization Energies** for a single element always increase (IE₁ < IE₂ < IE₃, etc.). A particularly significant jump in ionization energy is observed when core electrons are removed, as these are much more strongly attracted to the nucleus than valence electrons.[5]",

For instance, a larger atomic radius generally correlates with lower ionization energy because the valence electrons are further from the nucleus and less strongly attracted.[5, 8] Similarly, electronegativity is directly tied to the ease with which an atom can achieve a stable valence shell configuration.[8] The deviations observed in ionization energy further illustrate the subtle interplay of electron shielding and orbital energies, refining the understanding beyond simple linear trends. This comprehensive understanding of periodic trends enables chemists to anticipate how elements will react, form bonds, and behave in various chemical environments, which is critical for chemical synthesis, material design, and predicting reaction outcomes."

This transfer results in the formation of oppositely charged ions: the electron-donating atom becomes a positively charged cation, while the electron-accepting atom becomes a negatively charged anion.[9] The resulting bond is a strong electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions.[9] This mechanism often aligns with the octet rule, where atoms strive to attain eight electrons in their valence shell.[10]"

For example, iron primarily exhibits metallic bonding, but also possesses some covalent character.[11] The direct causal relationship between electron delocalization and these macroscopic properties is a cornerstone of materials science, enabling the design and manipulation of metallic alloys for specific applications based on their desired electrical, thermal, and mechanical characteristics."
