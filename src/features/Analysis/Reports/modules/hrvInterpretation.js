    wellness: `
        <p>This graph provides a high-level overview of your physiological state over the course of the measurement. It combines several key metrics into two intuitive scores:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recovery Score (0-100):</strong> This score reflects the dominance of your 'rest-and-digest' (parasympathetic) nervous system. It is primarily calculated from your RMSSD and resting heart rate. A higher score indicates a better state of recovery, suggesting your body is ready for strain.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain Score (0-100):</strong> This score reflects the level of stress or load on your system. It is calculated from your heart rate and its variability. A higher score indicates more physiological strain, which is expected during exercise but should be low during rest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By tracking these scores over time, you can better understand your body's response to training, sleep, and daily stressors, allowing you to optimize your performance and well-being.</p>
    `,
    tachogram: `
        <p>The Tachogram is the most fundamental view of your heart's activity, plotting each individual beat-to-beat interval (RR interval) over time. It is the raw data from which all other HRV metrics are derived.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What to look for:</strong> A healthy, well-regulated nervous system produces a 'spiky' and highly variable line, indicating that your heart rate is constantly making micro-adjustments. A flatter line suggests less adaptability and potential fatigue or stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> This graph is also the best place to visually identify artifacts (sudden, non-physiological spikes or dips). The faint grey line shows the original raw data, while the bold colored line shows the data after our automated filter has corrected these artifacts. You can also click on any point to manually remove it.</li>
        </ul>
    `,
    psd: `
        <p>The Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot is an advanced analysis that breaks down your heart rate variability into its underlying frequency components, revealing the influence of different parts of your nervous system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HF (High Frequency, 0.15-0.4Hz):</strong> This band, often called the 'respiratory band', is a pure indicator of your 'rest-and-digest' (parasympathetic) nervous system activity. Higher HF power is generally a sign of good recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>LF (Low Frequency, 0.04-0.15Hz):</strong> This band reflects the activity of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic ('fight-or-flight') systems. It is often associated with blood pressure regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>VLF (Very Low Frequency, 0.003-0.04Hz):</strong> This band is less understood but is thought to be related to very slow-acting regulatory systems like hormones and thermoregulation.</li>
        </ul>
    `,
    poincare: `
        <p>The Poincar√© Plot is a non-linear analysis method that visualizes the correlation between one heartbeat and the next. It provides a unique, qualitative view of your autonomic nervous system's dynamics.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shape:</strong> A healthy, adaptable system typically produces a comet-shaped or elongated ellipse. The 'cloud' of points should be well-distributed. A very tight, circular, or narrow shape can indicate high stress, fatigue, or an overly regular heart rhythm.</li>
            <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> The plot is quantified by <strong>SD1</strong> (the width of the cloud), which reflects short-term, parasympathetic variability, and <strong>SD2</strong> (the length of the cloud), which reflects longer-term, overall variability.</li>
        </ul>
    `,
    histogram: `
        <p>The RR Interval Histogram is a simple but powerful tool that shows the frequency distribution of all your recorded heartbeats. It tells you which heart rate intervals occurred most often during the measurement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What to look for:</strong> A wider, more spread-out histogram is a hallmark of high overall HRV, which is generally desirable. It means your heart rate was not 'stuck' in one place. A very tall, narrow peak indicates that most of your heartbeats were very similar in length, which can be a sign of physiological or psychological stress.</li>
        </ul>
    `,
    respiration: `
        <p>This graph shows your estimated breathing pattern, derived from the rhythmic fluctuations in your heart rate known as Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA). This is a direct, non-invasive way to observe the connection between your breathing and your nervous system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> When you inhale, your heart rate naturally speeds up. When you exhale, it slows down. The HF band of the PSD plot captures this rhythm. This graph visualizes that rhythm over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Uses:</strong> It's useful for seeing how your breathing rate changes during different states (e.g., rest vs. exercise) and for practicing controlled breathing exercises to actively increase your HRV.</li>
        </ul>
